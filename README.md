## How to install

- Open the “Download Link” .txt file where you will be navigated to a Google Drive folder, there you can download the correct build, for example if you are on mobile then get the Android.apk, for vr get the VR.apk and for PC, install the PCfolder.
- For VR and Android you will have to open the .apk and allow it to install, if prompted with “not allowed to download from unknown sources” or something similar, typically there is a prompt which you can navigate to which allows you to install it anyways. This is because the app is not widely recognised yet and it is not because it is flagged as suspicious, it is just unknown because it is new.
- Once installed, navigate to it and open it.
- On PC, run the .exe file.
- On all platforms the game will load for about a minute or two as the music and other settings are loaded.

Windows 10 and 11 were used to create and test Gunman Drift PC.
Android 14 and 15 were used to create and test Gunman Drift Android.
Meta Quest 2 was used to create and test Gunman Drift VR.

Specifications of the devices used are considered to be above average and no other device specifications have been noted therefore there is a limited amount of data on what devices can run it, however informal data shows that around 20% of a Ryzen 7 5700X3D processor and 3GB of ram are used by the game. This could suggest that a Ryzen 5 2600 would also be able to run the game. Minimum graphics card is likely an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti, possibly even weaker.
